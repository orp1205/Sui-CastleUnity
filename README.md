# We Castle: Blockchain Adventures

"We Castle: Blockchain Adventures" is an innovative Unity game designed specifically for the SUI blockchain hackathon. It combines elements of traditional role-playing games (RPGs) with blockchain mechanics, all wrapped up in a retro, text-based interface reminiscent of classic games like Zork.

Players embark on an epic quest through the virtual world of RST (Retro Style Text), where they must navigate through a series of challenges and puzzles using text-based commands. Along the way, they'll encounter various characters, collect items, and uncover the mysteries of the blockchain-powered universe.

The game leverages the SUI blockchain for unique features such as decentralized item ownership, in-game currency transactions, and player-driven events. Each decision made by the player is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability while enhancing the overall gaming experience.

With its blend of nostalgia-inducing gameplay and cutting-edge blockchain technology, "We Castle: Blockchain Adventures" offers a fresh and exciting take on both gaming and decentralized applications, making it a standout entry for the SUI blockchain hackathon.
